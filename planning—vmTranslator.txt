Proposed design ———— VM Translator

Parser
	Reads a VM command, parses command into components
	Ignores all whitespace and comments

	Constructor(input file): Opens input file and readies parsing
	hasMoreCommands: Boolean (Are there more commands to be parsed)
	advance: Reads next command and makes it current command. Only called if hasMoreCommands() === true.

CodeWriter
	Constructor(output file): Opens output file and readies writing
	writeArithmetic(command): Writes assembly code implementing arithmetic command.
	writePushPop(C_PUSH or C_POP, segment, index): Writes assembly code implementing push/pop command

Main
	Parse the input file with Parser
	Write the assembly code with CodeWriter
